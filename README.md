# Mount Vernon Explorer
Prototype of a new on-site visitor guide that is web-browser based

## Latest developments
The current version displays an Open Street Map and pulses your location every few seconds.  It retrieves a list of locations using our BigTree API and at each location update re-sorts the location list in the browser view to show you the POIs that are closest.

## Completed
- Create alternate view for out of bounds
- Edited OSM display for Mount Vernon

## Still To Do
- Better UI for the location listing
- Calculate distance (in feet)
- Create card view allowing you to see more details about a POIs
- Create alternate view for desktop (i.e. non-location device)
